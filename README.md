# training_sdf_estimators

Subrepository to work with bacon in the Robust Neural Fields project for [ADL4CV](https://niessner.github.io/ADL4CV/).
This Repository is for training simple baseline distance extractor networks to replace kdtree and nearest neighbor averaging in bacon distance extraction.
If interested in the project look at the our [MeshCNN implementation for NN Distance Extraction](https://github.com/julianstrietzel/MeshCNN).
