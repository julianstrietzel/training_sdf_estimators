# training_sdf_estimators

Subrepository to work with bacon in the Robust Neural Fields project for [ADL4CV](https://niessner.github.io/ADL4CV/).
This Repository is for training simple baseline distance extractor networks to replace kdtree and nearest neighbor averaging in bacon distance extraction.
For theoretical information look at our [midterm presentation]([url](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lkhXgq31yd0LC_89G88jLUj4K30wy_20AKmic8yo9Cw/edit?usp=sharing)https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lkhXgq31yd0LC_89G88jLUj4K30wy_20AKmic8yo9Cw/edit?usp=sharing).
